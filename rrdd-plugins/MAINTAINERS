List of maintainers and how to submit changes
=============================================

This is an early public release of the rrdd-plugins.

At the moment we are working hard on improving this early release, to make
it simple to build, install and test on your own environment. As such things
are in a state of flux, and we may well find it difficult to take submissions.

If you do wish to submit code, please fork the repository on Github, work on
your branch and then submit a pull request.
